# Project-1

This project is an app for employees of a company to submit reimbursement requests. 
Employees can view their requests, make a new request, and edit pending requests.
Managers can log in and manage requests. They can view pending requests, approve or deny a request, and view all request history.

The main technologies used in this project are Bootstrap and Servlet for the front end with DAO Architecture and JDBC for the backend.
